# 🚀 JavaScript API Integration Series

This repository is a dedicated space for my journey through asynchronous JavaScript. Each project focuses on a different aspect of communicating with external servers.

## 📋 Current Challenges

### 1. User Profile Update (POST Method)
- **Objective**: Submit multiple form fields (First Name and Last Name) to a REST API.
- **Concepts**: Request headers, POST method, and JSON serialization.

### 2. Student Grade Management (PUT Method)
- **Objective**: Update specific numerical data (grades 0-20) using the PUT method.
- **Concepts**: Data validation and API rate limiting.

### 3. Notification Checker & Chapter Filter (GET Method)
- **Objective**: Fetching data and handling "busy server" errors.
- **Concepts**: Response validation (`response.ok`), `.filter()` method, and network error catching.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **Fetch API**
- **HTML5 / CSS3**

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- How to transform raw HTTP responses into usable JavaScript objects using `.json()`.
- The importance of `JSON.stringify()` when sending data to a server.
- Why `try/catch` or `.catch()` is essential to prevent application crashes during network failures.
