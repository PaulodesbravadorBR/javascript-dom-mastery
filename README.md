# 🚀 JavaScript DOM Mastery

A comprehensive collection of **68 structured lessons** and professional projects focused on mastering Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation and asynchronous API integrations.



## 📌 Project Overview
This repository serves as a complete archive of my progress in Frontend development, moving from basic element selection to complex real-world API communication.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills Demonstrated
* **Advanced DOM Manipulation:** Efficient node selection, dynamic rendering, and event delegation.
* **API Integrations:** Practical implementation using the GitHub REST API and custom endpoints.
* **Asynchronous Programming:** Professional use of `Async/Await`, `Promises`, and the `.finally()` block for UI state management.
* **Clean Architecture:** Utilizing reusable classes like `PacoteBuscador` for API abstraction.
